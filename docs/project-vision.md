# Project Vision

The aim of git-clarity is to provide a free visual environment for common tasks in a git repository as a companion to the git CLI rather than a replacement.

## Scope

The criteria for determining whether a feature is suitable for git-clarity can be summarised as follows:

* Does the feature support a useful scenario to me?
* Does it work with any standard git repository or widely used extension to a git repository?
* Can it be implemented in git-clarity with some benefit over using it from the CLI?

Based off that some scenarios that are not suitable for git-clarity are:

* Supporting any workflows explictly in git-clarity.
    * The git-clarity tool will be workflow agnostic like git itself.
* Integrating with any git hosting provider.
    * The git-clarity tool will work with any standard git repository.

## Free as in?

The git-clarity tool will be released as free software under the GPLv3.
