# Feature Ideas

This is a scratch pad of features I would like to have. The next step is to enumerate scenarios for the features and the tool so that the implementation is guided towards a good experience for the user.

* Repository history view.
    * Visual graph.
    * Filtering, sorting.
    * Integrated diff viewer.
    * Searching through commit metadata and contents(requires indexing?).
    * Merge, rebase, cherry pick helper.
* Commit authoring view.
    * Write commit messages.
    * Stage partial or full changes.
    * Conflict resolution helper.
* Stashes view.
* Reflog view.
    * Use this as integrated undo/redo functionality.
* Rename helper/tracker.
* Repository maintenance tools.
    * Statistics, visualisations.
    * gitattributes helper.
    * git gc helper.
    * git config helper.
    * gitignore helper.
* Submodules support.
* Worktree support.
* Git LFS support.
* Launch from terminal.
* Support git hooks.

Probably should also think about remote operations like
